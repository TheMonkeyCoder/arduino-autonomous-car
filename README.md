<h3>Autonomous car with Arduino UNO, Android and OpenCV</h3>

<h4>This is an old and unoptimised piece of software. I am sorry but right now I have no intention of working on it.</h4>

Model car which can drive without human input. It is capable of following the street shape, with the help of an Android smartphone mounted in front of it. An application employs phone's camera to detect street lines and sends data to Arduino Uno via Bluetooth. Arduino manages all the car movements, including the obstacle overtaking, achieved through the use of ultrasonic sensors.

The app is optimised for a 480x800 pixels screen. If your resolution is different the app may not work as expected. In order to run it you have to install OpenCV Manager from <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.opencv.engine">Play Store</a>.
